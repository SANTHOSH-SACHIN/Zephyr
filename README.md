This conversational is created and deployed using the open-source Llama 2 LLM model from Meta.

Particularly, I've used the [**Llama2-7B**](https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama7b-v2-chat) model deployed by the Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) team and hosted on the [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) platform.
